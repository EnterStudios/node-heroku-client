# log-drain

[Log drains](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#syslog-drains) provide a way to forward your Heroku logs to an external syslog server for long-term archiving. This external service must be configured to receive syslog packets from Heroku, whereupon its URL can be added to an app using this API.
